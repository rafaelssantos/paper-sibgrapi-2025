abstract = {In volume visualization, users typically specify transfer functions to classify the data and assign visual attributes to each material class. Higher-dimensional classification makes it easier to differentiate material classes since more data properties are considered. One of the difficulties in using higher-dimensional classification is the absence of appropriate user interfaces. We introduce an intuitive user interface that allows the user to work in the cluster space, which shows the material classes with a set of material widgets, rather than work in the transfer function space. This interface not only provides the user the capability to specify arbitrary-dimensional transfer functions, but also allows the user to operate directly on the classification and visualization results.},

abstract = {Multi-dimensional transfer functions are an efficient way to visualize features in scalar volume data produced by CT or MRI scanners. However, the optimal transfer function is difficult to find in general. We present an automatic yet powerful method for the automatic setup of multi-dimensional transfer functions by adding spatial information to the histogram of a volume. Using this information we can easily classify the histogram and derive a transfer function by assigning unique colors to each class of the histogram.Each feature can be selected interactively by pointing and clicking at the corresponding class in the transfer function. In order to render the classified volume with adequate quality we propose an extension of the wellknown pre-integration technique. Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by giving examples for the imaging of segmented, diffusion-tensor and multi-modal data.},

However, facing different application requirements in specific cases, one may need pertinent methods to visualize volume data and highlight specific volume features. In this paper, we review and classify the existing literature on feature enhancement volume rendering. The classification is conducted based on the enhancement of four types of features (the external feature, the internal feature, the structure feature, and the ideographic feature) in volume data. Finally, we conclude this survey with future challenges in feature enhancement volume visualization.}

abstract = {Volume rendering produces informative two-dimensional (2D) images from a 3-dimensional (3D) volume. It highlights the region of interest and facilitates a good comprehension of the entire data set. However, volume rendering faces a few challenges. First, a high-dimensional transfer function is usually required to differentiate the target from its neighboring objects with subtle variance. Unfortunately, designing such a transfer function is a strenuously trial-and-error process. Second, manipulating/visualizing a 3D volume with a traditional 2D input/output device suffers dimensional limitations. To address all the challenges, we design NUI-VR2, a natural user interface-enabled volume rendering system in the virtual reality space. NUI-VR2 marries volume rendering and interactive image segmentation. It transforms the original volume into a probability map with image segmentation. A simple linear transfer function will highlight the target well in the probability map. More importantly, we set the entire image segmentation and volume rendering pipeline in an immersive virtual reality environment with a natural user interface. NUI-VR2 eliminates the dimensional limitations in manipulating and perceiving 3D volumes and dramatically improves the user experience.},
