Various aspects of transfer functions (TFs) have been extensively discussed in the literature~\cite{ljung2016}. This review focuses on strategies for managing the complexity of defining multidimensional TFs, particularly those involving machine learning, dimensionality reduction, and information visualization techniques.

Histograms are commonly used in 2D TF design, often representing intensity versus gradient magnitude. Automated approaches frequently combine histogram analysis with clustering algorithms such as affinity propagation~\cite{zhang2016}, hierarchical clustering~\cite{sereda2006}, iterative self-organizing methods~\cite{tzeng2004}, and gradient and coordinate-based classification~\cite{roettger2005}.

Multidimensional TF design typically follows two main strategies: (i) interactive interfaces that allow direct manipulation of data attributes, such as parallel coordinate plots (PCPs); and (ii) dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), that generate simplified visual representations~\cite{tory2005, zhao2010, guo2011}.

Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) have been employed for dimensionality reduction and interactive map generation~\cite{moura2007}. Extensions include spherical SOMs~\cite{khan2015}, hierarchical clustering with modified dendrograms~\cite{wang2011}, and normalized cuts for generating cell maps~\cite{cai2017}. Our method builds upon the approach proposed by Cai et al.~\cite{cai2017}, combining MDS with density-based clustering to support automated material classification.

Supervised learning methods have also been explored in TF design. These include neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs)~\cite{tzeng2005}, SOMs combined with backpropagation~\cite{wang2006}, and deep learning techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for TF generation and volume visualization~\cite{berger2018, hong2019, kim2021, pan2024}.
