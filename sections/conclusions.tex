\section{Conclusions}
\label{sect:conclusions}

We presented a robust method for TF design that provides semi-automated feature classification and a simplified volume interaction space. Our method exhibits low computational overhead, as confirmed by short runtimes, highlighting its practicality and scalability for real-world applications.

Future work will focus on assessing the performance of the method with large, high-dimensional datasets to further validate its scalability and effectiveness.

Moreover, we aim to extend our evaluation to multivariate data, enhancing the applicability and robustness of the method across a wider range of volume datasets.
