\section{Conclusions}
\label{sect:conclusions}

We presented a robust method for transfer function (TF) design that integrates feature classification with a simplified volume exploration space. Our approach combines FastMap for efficient feature extraction, DBSCAN for effective clustering, and SSS for pivot-based indexing. These techniques enable semi-automatic classification and initial TF specification, visualized through an intuitive scatter plot interface for volume exploration.

The method exhibits low computational overhead, short runtimes, and minimal storage requirements, highlighting its practicality and scalability for real-world applications. Future work will focus on assessing the method’s performance with large, high-dimensional datasets to validate its scalability and effectiveness.

Moreover, we aim to extend our evaluation to multivariate data, enhancing the method’s applicability and robustness across a wider range of volume datasets.
