\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:introduction}

Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) is widely used in scientific and medical applications to visualize three-dimensional scalar data. A key element in DVR is the transfer function (TF), which maps volume data attributes (e.g., density) to visual properties such as color and opacity~\cite{ljung2016}.

Multidimensional TFs can enhance data classification, but their design becomes increasingly complex with more input attributes~\cite{ljung2016, pan2024}. Since no universal TF fits all datasets, design is often manual and highly dependent on user expertise~\cite{arens2010}. Dimensionality and non-intuitive parameter spaces further complicate the process.

We propose a low-cost, unsupervised TF design method. Our approach combines clustering, dimensionality reduction, and representative selection to support semi-automated TF definitions. A modified 2D scatter plot interface facilitates intuitive exploration of volume features of interest (FOI).

Our method contributions are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A computationally efficient method for TF design.
    \item An initial semi-automated TF definition.
    \item A simplified exploration interface based on classified volume FOIs.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sect:related-works} reviews related work. Section~\ref{sect:method} presents our method. Section~\ref{sect:volume-exploration} describes the TF design interface. Results and discussion are given in Sections~\ref{sect:results} and~\ref{sect:discussion}. Finally, Section~\ref{sect:conclusions} concludes the paper.
