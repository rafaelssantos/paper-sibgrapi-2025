\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:introduction}

Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) is widely used in scientific and medical applications to visualize 3D scalar data. A key element in DVR is the transfer function (TF), which maps volume data attributes (e.g., density) to visual properties such as color and opacity~\cite{ljung2016}.

Multidimensional TFs can enhance data classification, but their design becomes increasingly complex as more input attributes are considered~\cite{ljung2016, pan2024}. Since no universal TF fits all datasets, the design process is often manual and highly dependent on user expertise~\cite{arens2010}. The high dimensionality and non-intuitive parameter spaces further complicate this task.

We propose a computationally efficient TF design method that combines clustering, dimensionality reduction and representative selection. Our approach provides:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A simplified TF design interface with an initially generated TF definition.
    \item A semi-automated identification of features of interest (FOIs) based on volume data.
    \item An interactive exploration interface based on classified volume FOIs.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sect:related-works} reviews related work. Section~\ref{sect:method} presents our method. Section~\ref{sect:volume-exploration} describes the TF design interface. Results are discussed in Sections~\ref{sect:results}. Finally, Section~\ref{sect:conclusions} concludes the paper.
